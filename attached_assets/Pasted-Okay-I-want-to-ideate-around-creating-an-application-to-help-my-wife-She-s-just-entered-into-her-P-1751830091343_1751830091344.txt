Okay, I want to ideate around creating an application to help my wife. She's just entered into her PhD program. I've created a project GPT, which is basically a research assistant. A number of books and resources will be ragged in there, and I've got a system prompt. I've just created that, but I've run up against a limitation of 10 files, so what I'd like to do is to create a more robust application, relatively simple in function, essentially duplicating what a project GPT does, but extending the number of files. I'd like to have user authentication, so multiple people can go in and use this application for research purposes, log in and keep chats persistent so that they can go back in and reference them. They should be able to organize their chats. This is something that's not available in project GPT today. Since this is a research assistant, I'm going to call them lines of inquiry. This is research focused. That's the paradigm for the application. It's a research assistant, which allows you as a user to log in and upload various files and resources and have them persistently stay there on the back end. I guess that would be stored in a vectorized database somehow, chunked automatically and all of that stuff. The user experience should be relatively straightforward. I come to the main screen. I create an account if I don't already have one. I log in if I have an account, and I have the ability to see my existing lines of inquiry. The first time I log in, of course, there's nothing there, so I would start by what's your line of inquiry? And that line of inquiry would allow you to choose your resources. I think maybe as I'm ideating with you right now around this, for a very robust application, probably you'd want to have like a reference stack. So you'd be able to choose what you want to put into that reference set. Multiple resources could go into that reference set. And then you would have lines of inquiry against that reference set of resources. So I might have, for example, two very focused reference sets. One's around executive coaching, and another around Tazkiyat-un-Nafs. So as a researcher, I have different areas of expertise, areas I'd like to do lines of inquiry in. I'd like to be able to come into the application and set those up. So for Tazkiyat-un-Nafs, I would upload various resources and have them persistently available. Again, more than 10. So this would be a vectorized database. Everything would be chunked and embedded and available for inquiry. And then I would have chats, which essentially are lines of inquiry. I'd ask questions, have a chat back and forth as a normal LLM would. And all of this is stored and made persistent. And then I might have another reference set around executive coaching and have other different resources uploaded there and chunked and embedded and so on and so forth. But from a user perspective, I just want to upload a file, have it always available, be able to upload multiple files and be able to ask questions and have the appropriate results cross-referenced amongst files with proper formal citations. Since this is a research paradigm, of course, we have to adhere to all research principles of proper citation and attribution and so on and so forth. So I can set up as a user, I can log in, create my own account, create a reference set or a research stack or come on, let's come up with some language around that. What is that set of resources that I'd like to form lines of inquiry against and then do those lines of inquiry. I'm thinking at a meta level, I might want to create lines of inquiries that goes across reference sets. So let's call that multidisciplinary inquiry. So I'd like to be able to set up a line of inquiry that crosses multiple disciplines that accesses the multiple reference sets. Obviously, I've only have to upload those files once, probably by domain, as I suggested. Tasqeerat-e-Nafs is a domain, executive coaching is a domain, Quran and Hadith might be another domain. And so I can do lines of inquiry independently against those separate domains or do a line of inquiry that's cross-disciplinary and then be able to select which domains I would like to cross over. Okay. So this is high level, the structure of the type of app I would like to create. I like this to be very simple to create. Probably not a high volume app for now. My wife's the only one going to be using it. My wife and I will be the only ones using it. But we expect to commercialize this. Okay. And make it available to people. To that end, let's think about building in monetization. So there's some sort of free tier that allows you to have a certain number of inquiries per day, maybe, or a certain number of reference sets, maybe only one reference set, a limited number of files greater than ChatGPT's 10. So there has to be value here. A free tier and then beyond that, it would be monetized. So I need to be able to monetize this. Let's talk about what this would look like from a structural perspective and then what the MVP would be just to get started and test out the idea. Maybe not doing the monetization up front, but building it in such a way that that's allowable. Definitely need to have multiple users from day one. Definitely need to have multiple domain reference sets that an individual user can upload files to and make inquiries on. And then also the cross-domain multidisciplinary lines of inquiry. So go ahead and give me some ideas on how we can do this. And we'll go from there.  In anticipation os some of your question, from a technical perspective, I'll want to use pinecone and supabase with flask and react. Also Docling for the document ingestion, chunking and embedding. But do the analysis FIRST, then use my technical direction.


ChatGPT said:
Thanks for this incredibly rich and well-thought-out vision. You're articulating a serious productivity and research assistant for academic and professional use. Let‚Äôs break this down into key conceptual components, map them to functional features, define an MVP, and then apply your preferred technical stack in the architecture.

üß† CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
üë§ Users
Authenticated accounts.

Persistent data (reference sets, chats/lines of inquiry).

Roles later (free vs paid).

üìö Reference Sets / Domains
Think of these as organized collections of documents, grouped by thematic area or research focus.

Each user can have multiple Reference Sets (e.g., ‚ÄúTazkiyat-un-Nafs‚Äù or ‚ÄúExecutive Coaching‚Äù).

Reference Sets are composed of multiple uploaded files (PDFs, Word, etc.).

Files are embedded and stored vectorized for semantic search.

üßµ Lines of Inquiry (Chats)
These are LLM chat sessions bound to one or more reference sets.

Tied to a single reference set or multiple (multidisciplinary mode).

Each interaction stored as a persistent thread (chat).

Fully searchable, with proper metadata.

Citations drawn from referenced material with proper academic formatting (APA, MLA, etc.).

üß© Multidisciplinary Inquiries
You select multiple reference sets (e.g., Quranic Psychology + Executive Coaching).

Chat context draws embeddings from all selected sets.

Still stored as a unique line of inquiry.

üí° Core Principles
Persistence: All user data stored.

Structure: Reference Set ‚Üí Lines of Inquiry.
